1. Did you model the first object falling without drag? (yes / no)

2. What time should it take if the height is 500 cm and g = 981 cm/s^2?

3. Does your code behave like it does in the example at the end of Step 4 (yes / no)?



2. Did you add the path in Step 7  (yes / no) ? When the blob changes direction is it smooth and curvy or 
does the path have sharp corners? How realistic is this to real life?


3. Did you add a plot of vx versus time (yes / no)? Does this plot make sense to you? Why does it look the way it does?
Why does it look like a bunch of flat lines or rectangles?


4. Did you give the blob an initial velocity (Step 9) ? What happens when you set vx = 25  and vy = 25?


5. Did you get all green check marks for the objectives of this activity? Which objectives are still ? or X?
Note: The check mark for "Fix the drift in the y direction" will go back to ? after you give the blob
an initial velocity. That's ok. Just make sure it is not X.
